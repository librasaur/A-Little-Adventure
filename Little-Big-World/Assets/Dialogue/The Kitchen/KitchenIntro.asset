    - Ah, we made it!
    - Well done everyone, see I told you we'd be just fine
    - That doesn't mean there weren't any close calls
    - We still have to actually borrow our food. How are we meant to get all the way
      up to those counters?
    - Hmm, you know what? I might just be able to give you a boost!
    - You can already jump high, just jump on my shoulders and I'll give you a little
      extra height
    - But then how are we meant to get up there?
    - Come on, we've already done it once before!
