    - Alright everyone, think we've got everything we need?
    - Sugar, bread, apple slices, onions, raspberries, pepper, salt. . .
    - That should last us for weeks!
    - It'd better!
    - Well, all that's left to do now is get back home
    - We have to do all that again?
    - Nope, I know a little shortcut we can take, it'll take us straight back home
    - There's a shortcut?! Why didn't we come that way in the first place?!
    - Because then we'd never have had this little adventure!
