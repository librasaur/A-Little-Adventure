    - Whew, I haven't had to move that fast in a long time!
    - I think maybe I should start getting out more
    - Come on guys, that was fun!
    - That's one way to put it. . .
    - We've just got to get through one last room and then we've made it to the kitchen
    - And please tell me there's not going to be anything else to avoid or run-away
      from?
    - Well. . .
    - Oh dear. . .
    - They do have a cat who likes to roam around the dining room looking for any
      scraps from last night's dinner
    - Uh oh, what if it mistakes us for some scraps?!
    - Just make sure the cat doesn't see you then! We might have to split our different
      ways
    - Let's all meet up at the door to the kitchen
