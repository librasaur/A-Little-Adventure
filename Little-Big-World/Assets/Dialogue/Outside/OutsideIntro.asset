    - Right, so the window right up there is the entrance into the bedroom and that's
      our ticket into the house
    - But how are we meant to get up there?
    - Well, the ivy, of course
    - Ohhhh no, that's too unsafe, I can't do that!
    - You'll be absolutely fine, Raine and I could travel up there with out eyes closed
    - Uh, Dad, some of the leaves don't look that stable actually, I'm not sure they'd
      take that much weight
    - I know I've been eating a lot of cake lately, but I haven't put on that much
    - No, Dad, something's been eating at the leaves so they're not as secure as before
    - Whelp, looks like we'll have to find another way in
    - I have an idea! I could climb these just fine, then hang my rope down and you
      guys climb up
    - There's no other way in so that'll have to do
    - Ohhhh, alright then, please be careful Raine!
