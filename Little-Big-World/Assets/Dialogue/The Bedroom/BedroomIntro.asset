    - See? We made it here all in one piece!
    - How much farther have we got to go?
    - Oh, not far, we just have to get to the ground and through the hallway, through
      the dining room and then into the kitchen and gather the food
    - Oh. . . great
    - Um, Mum, Dad, I think we've got a bit of an eight-legged issue
    - What's the problem?
    - It looks like we've got a bit of a spider problem
    - SPIDERS?!
    - They're not too much trouble, just make sure they don't fall on your head
