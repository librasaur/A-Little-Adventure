    - Phew! That was a close one!
    - Too close!
    - Well, now we've got past that, we've just got to find a way to the floor
    - Look, someone's left their drawers open, we could get down that way
    - Those gaps are way too big, even I couldn't jump those
    - Connie, did you wear your scarf today?
    - . . . Yes
    - You could parachute down to those drawer's!
    - Parachute?! I couldn't even climb the ivy!
    - Dad has a point, you're great with tools and you're the lightest out of the
      three of us, you could easily make it
    - And then once you get down to the drawer, push something up so we can get down
      to you
    - I guess there's no other choise
